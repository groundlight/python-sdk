"""We use a trick to check if libraries like numpy are installed or not.
If they are, we make it available as normal.
If not, we set it up as a shim object which still lets type-hinting work properly,
but will fail at runtime if you try to use it.

This can be confusing, but hopefully the errors are explicit enough to be 
clear about what's happening, and it makes the code which hopes numpy is installed
look readable.
