      # It's totally debatable which is better here: fail-fast or not.
      # Failing fast will use fewer cloud resources, in theory.
      #    But if the tests are slightly flaky (fail to pip install something)
      #    Then one flaky install kills lots of jobs that need to be redone.
      #    So the efficiency argument has its limits
      # Failing slow is clearer about what's going on.
      #    This is pretty unambiguous, so we're going with it for now.
