# Installing on Linux

This guide will help you install the Groundlight SDK on Linux. The Groundlight SDK requires Python 3.9 or higher.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Basic Installation

Assuming you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system, you can proceed with the following steps to install or upgrade the Groundlight SDK:

### Installing Groundlight SDK

To install the Groundlight SDK using pip, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install groundlight
```

If you're also using `python2` on your system, you might need to use `pip3` instead:

```bash
pip3 install groundlight
```

The Groundlight SDK is now installed and ready for use.

### Checking Groundlight SDK Version

To check if the Groundlight SDK is installed and to display its version, you can use the following Python one-liner:

```bash
python -c "import groundlight; print(groundlight.__version__)"
```

or the groundlight command line tool that comes with the SDK:

```bash
groundlight --help
```

### Upgrading Groundlight SDK

If you need to upgrade the Groundlight SDK to the latest version, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade groundlight
```

Or, if you're using `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade groundlight
```

After upgrading, you can use the Python one-liner mentioned in the "Checking Groundlight SDK Version" section to verify that the latest version is now installed.

## Getting the right Python Version

To check your installed Python version, open a terminal and run:

```bash
python --version
```

If you see a version number starting with "3.9" or higher (e.g., "3.9.5" or "3.9.0"), you're good to go. If not, you might need to upgrade Python on your system.

### Upgrading Python on Linux

Use your distribution's package manager to install the latest Python version:

- For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3
  ```

  (For Ubuntu 18.04 see note below.)

- For Fedora-based systems:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3
  ```

- For Arch Linux:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S python
  ```

After upgrading, verify the Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`, as described earlier.

### Special note about Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 still uses python 3.6 by default, which is end-of-life. We generally recommend using python 3.10. If you know how to install py3.10, please go ahead. But the easiest version of python 3 to use with Ubuntu 18.04 is python 3.9, which can be installed as follows without adding any extra repositories:

```shell
# Prepare Ubuntu to install things
sudo apt-get update
# Install the basics
sudo apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-distutils curl
# Configure `python3` to run python3.9 by default
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.9 10
# Download and install pip3.9
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > /tmp/get-pip.py
sudo python3.9 /tmp/get-pip.py
# Configure `pip3` to run pip3.9
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip3 pip3 $(which pip3.9) 10
# Now we can install Groundlight!
pip3 install groundlight
```

## Ready to go!

You're now ready to start using the Groundlight SDK in your projects. For more information on using the SDK, refer to the [API Tokens](../getting-started/5-api-tokens.md) documentation and the [Building Applications Guide](../guide/).
