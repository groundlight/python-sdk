# No-Code IoT Deployment

We built a tool for deploying your Groundlight detector on any supported ESP32 Camera Board without writing any code. This tool is available at https://code.groundlight.ai/groundlight-embedded-uploader/.

## Easy Deployment

This tool is designed to make it as easy as possible to deploy your Groundlight detector on an ESP32 Camera Board. You can deploy your detector in just a few clicks.

1. Go to https://code.groundlight.ai/groundlight-embedded-uploader/.
2. Plug your ESP32 Camera Board into your computer with a USB cable.
3. Click through the steps to upload your detector to your ESP32 Camera Board.

## Notification Options

The tool supports the following notification options for your deployed detector:

- Email
- SMS (With Twilio)
- Slack

## Multiple Supported Boards

The supported boards are:

- M5Stack ESP32 PSRAM Timer Camera X [[purchase here](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/esp32-psram-timer-camera-x-ov3660?variant=36362228301988)]
- AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM [[purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ESP32-CAM&i=electronics&crid=10JXSSPIN5ZZ1&sprefix=,electronics,340)]
