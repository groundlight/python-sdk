# Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson

Groundlight's SDK works great on ARM devices like Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson.

```
pip3 install groundlight
```

an ARM-compatible version will automatically get installed.

## Streams

If you have `docker` installed on your Pi, you can even just run 

```
docker run groundlight/stream
```

as we publish an ARM version of our streaming application to dockerhub.
