# Guide

Groundlight provides a powerful "computer vision powered by natural language" system that enables you to build visual applications with minimal code. With Groundlight, you can quickly create applications for various use cases, from simple object detection to complex visual analysis.

On the following pages, we'll guide you through the process of building applications with Groundlight.
- **[Grabbing images](2-grabbing-images.md)**: Understand the intricacies of how to submit images from various input sources to Groundlight.
- **[Working with detectors](3-working-with-detectors.md)**: Learn how to create, configure, and use detectors in your Groundlight-powered applications.
- **[Submitting image queries](4-submitting-image-queries.md)**: Submit images to Groundlight for analysis and retrieve the results.
- **[Detector answer modes](5-detector-modes.md)**: Answer counting and multi-classification queries with Groundlight.
- **[Confidence levels](6-managing-confidence.md)**: Master how to control the trade-off of latency against accuracy by configuring the desired confidence level for your detectors.
- **[Handling errors](7-handling-errors.md)**: Understand how to handle and troubleshoot HTTP errors (`ApiException`) that may occur while using Groundlight.
- **[Asynchronous queries](8-async-queries.md)**: Groundlight makes it easy to submit asynchronous queries. Learn how to submit queries asynchronously and retrieve the results later.
- **[Using Groundlight on the edge](9-edge.md)**: Discover how to deploy Groundlight in edge computing environments for improved performance and reduced latency.
- **[Alerts](10-alerts.md)**: Learn how to set up alerts to notify you via text (SMS) or email when specific conditions are met in your visual applications.


By exploring these resources and sample applications, you'll be well on your way to building powerful visual applications using Groundlight's computer vision and natural language capabilities.
