# Sample Applications

Explore these GitHub repositories to see examples of Groundlight-powered applications:

## Groundlight Stream Processor

Repository: [https://github.com/groundlight/stream](https://github.com/groundlight/stream)

The Groundlight Stream Processor is an easy-to-use Docker container for analyzing RTSP streams or common USB-based cameras. You can run it with a single Docker command, such as:

```bash
docker run stream:local --help
```

## Arduino ESP32 Camera Sample App

Repository: [https://github.com/groundlight/esp32cam](https://github.com/groundlight/esp32cam)

This sample application allows you to build a working AI vision detector using an inexpensive WiFi camera. With a cost of under $10, you can create a powerful and affordable AI vision system.

## Raspberry Pi

Repository: [https://github.com/groundlight/raspberry-pi-door-lock](https://github.com/groundlight/raspberry-pi-door-lock)

This sample application demonstrates how to set up a Raspberry Pi-based door lock system. The application monitors a door and sends a notification if the door is observed to be unlocked during non-standard business hours.

## Industrial and Manufacturing Applications

Groundlight can be used to [apply modern natural-language-based computer vision to industrial and manufacturing applications](/docs/building-applications/industrial).
