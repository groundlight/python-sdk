# Detector Answer Modes

Groundlight offers several detector modalities to suit different computer vision tasks. While previous examples have focused on binary classification, this guide will walk you through using counting and multi-class detectors. Let's explore how these different modes can be used via the Groundlight SDK.

- **[Binary Detectors](1-binary-detectors.md)**: Learn how to create detectors that answer yes/no questions about images.
- **[Multiple Choice (Choose One) Detectors](2-multi-choice-detectors.md)**: Create detectors that select one answer from a predefined list of options.
- **[Count Detectors](3-counting-detectors.md)**: Use detectors to count the number of objects present in an image - and return bounding boxes around the counted objects.
