# Getting Started

## Computer Vision powered by Natural Language

Build a working computer vision system in just a few lines of python:

```python
from groundlight import Groundlight

gl = Groundlight()
det = gl.get_or_create_detector(name="doorway", query="Is the doorway open?")
img = "./docs/static/img/doorway.jpg"  # Image can be a file or a Python object
image_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=det, image=img)
print(f"The answer is {image_query.result}")
```

_Note: The SDK is currently in "beta" phase. Interfaces are subject to change in future versions. We will follow [semver](https://semver.org/) semantics for breaking changes._

### How does it work?

Your images are first analyzed by machine learning (ML) models which are automatically trained on your data. If those models have high enough [confidence](docs/building-applications/managing-confidence), that's your answer. But if the models are unsure, then the images are progressively escalated to more resource-intensive analysis methods up to real-time human review. So what you get is a computer vision system that starts working right away without even needing to first gather and label a dataset. At first it will operate with high latency, because people need to review the image queries. But over time, the ML systems will learn and improve so queries come back faster with higher confidence.

### Escalation Technology

Groundlight's Escalation Technology combines the power of generative AI using our Visual LLM, along with the speed of edge computing, and the reliability of real-time human oversight.

## Building a simple visual application

1.  Install the `groundlight` SDK. Requires python version 3.7 or higher. See [prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

    ```shell
    pip3 install groundlight
    ```

1.  Head over to the [groundlight web
    app](https://app.groundlight.ai/reef/my-account/api-tokens) to create an [API token](/docs/getting-started/api-tokens). You will
    need to set the `GROUNDLIGHT_API_TOKEN` environment variable to access the API.

    ```shell
    export GROUNDLIGHT_API_TOKEN=api_2GdXMflhJi6L_example
    ```

1.  Create a python script.

    ```python title="ask.py"
    from groundlight import Groundlight

    gl = Groundlight()
    det = gl.get_or_create_detector(name="doorway", query="Is the doorway open?")
    img = "./docs/static/img/doorway.jpg"  # Image can be a file or a Python object
    image_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=det, image=img)
    print(f"The answer is {image_query.result}")
    ```

1.  Run it!

    ```shell
    python ask.py
    ```
