# Getting Started

## Computer Vision powered by Natural Language

Build a working computer vision system in just a few lines of python:

```python
from groundlight import Groundlight
from PIL import Image
import requests

gl = Groundlight()
d = gl.get_or_create_detector(name="doorway", query="Is the doorway open?")
image_url= "https://images.selfstorage.com/large-compress/2174925f24362c479b2.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw)
image_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=d, image=image)
print(f"The answer is {image_query.result}")
```

### How does it work?

Your images are first analyzed by machine learning (ML) models which are automatically trained on your data. If those models have high enough confidence, that's your answer. But if the models are unsure, then the images are progressively escalated to more resource-intensive analysis methods up to real-time human review. So what you get is a computer vision system that starts working right away without even needing to first gather and label a dataset. At first it will operate with high latency, because people need to review the image queries. But over time, the ML systems will learn and improve so queries come back faster with higher confidence.

_Note: The SDK is currently in "beta" phase. Interfaces are subject to change in future versions._

## Getting Started

1.  Install the `groundlight` SDK. Requires python version 3.7 or higher. See [prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

    ```shell
    pip3 install groundlight
    ```

1.  Head over to the [groundlight web
    app](https://app.groundlight.ai/reef/my-account/api-tokens) to create an API token. You will
    need to set the `GROUNDLIGHT_API_TOKEN` environment variable to access the API.

    ```shell
    export GROUNDLIGHT_API_TOKEN=api_2GdXMflhJi6L_example
    ```

1.  Create a python script.

    ```python title="ask.py"
    from groundlight import Groundlight
    from PIL import Image
    import requests

    gl = Groundlight()
    d = gl.get_or_create_detector(name="doorway", query="Is the doorway open?")
    image_url= "https://images.selfstorage.com/large-compress/2174925f24362c479b2.jpg"
    image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw)
    image_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=d, image=image)
    print(f"The answer is {image_query.result}")
    ```

1.  Run it!

    ```shell
    $ python ask.py
    ```
