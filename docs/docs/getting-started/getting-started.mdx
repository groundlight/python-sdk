# Getting Started with Groundlight

## Build Computer Vision Applications in Minutes with Groundlight's Python SDK

Welcome to Groundlight AI! This guide will help you build your first computer vision application quickly and easily using our Python SDK.

Don't code? [Contact our team](mailto:support@groundlight.ai) and we'll build a custom solution for you.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. A [Groundlight account](https://dashboard.groundlight.ai/)
2. An API token from the [Groundlight dashboard](https://dashboard.groundlight.ai/reef/my-account/api-tokens)
3. Python 3.9 or newer

### Installing the Groundlight SDK

You can install the Groundlight SDK via pip. When installing python packages, it is a best practice to install them
inside of virtual environments. Run the following in the command line to create a new environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv groundlight-env
```

Activate the virtual environment using
- On macOS or Linux, `source groundlight-env/bin/activate`
- On Windows, `.\groundlight-env\Scripts\activate`

Now, you can install the Groundlight SDK using pip:
```bash
pip install groundlight
```

For more detailed installation instructions, see the [installation guide](/docs/installation/).

### Authentication

In order to verify your identity while connecting to your custom ML models through our SDK, you’ll need to create an API token.

1. Log into your previously created account at https://dashboard.groundlight.ai/

2. Once in, click on your username in the upper right hand corner of your dashboard:

3. Select API Tokens, then enter a name for your api token, such as `personal-laptop-token`.

4. Copy the API Token for use in your code

Set the API token in your terminal:
```bash
# MacOS / Linux
export GROUNDLIGHT_API_TOKEN='your-api-token'
```
```powershell
# Windows
setx GROUNDLIGHT_API_TOKEN "your-api-token"
```
:::important
Keep your API token secure! Anyone who has access to it can impersonate you and can access to your Groundlight data.
:::

### Call the Groundlight API

Call the Groundlight API by creating a `Detector` and submitting an `ImageQuery`.

You can start using Groundlight using just your laptop camera, but you can also use a USB camera if you have one.

```python title="ask.py"
from groundlight import Groundlight, Detector, ImageQuery

gl = Groundlight()

detector = gl.get_or_create_detector(detector_name, detector_query)
detector: Detector = gl.get_or_create_detector(
    name="thumbs-up",
    query="Is the thumb facing up?",
)

img = "./docs/static/img/thumb.jpg"  # Image can be a file or a Python object
image_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=det, image=img)

print(f"The answer is {image_query.result.label}")
print(image_query)
```

Run the code using `python ask.py`. The code will submit an image to the Groundlight API and print the result:
```
The answer is NO
ImageQuery(
    id='iq_2pL5wwlefaOnFNQx1X6awTOd119',
    query="Is the thumb facing up?",
    detector_id='det_2owcsT7XCsfFlu7diAKgPKR4BXY',
    result=BinaryClassificationResult(
        confidence=0.9995857543478209,
        label=<Label.YES: 'YES'>
    ),
    created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 25, 11, 5, 57, 38627, tzinfo=tzutc()),
    patience_time=30.0,
    confidence_threshold=0.9,
    type=<ImageQueryTypeEnum.image_query: 'image_query'>,
    result_type=<ResultTypeEnum.binary_classification: 'binary_classification'>,
    metadata=None
)
```

For more information on the Groundlight SDK, see the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference/), or check out our [guide to building applications with the Groundlight SDK](/docs/guide/).

### Using Your Computer Vision Application

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional computer vision application. You can easily customize the code and configure detectors for your specific use cases.

Monitor and enhance your detector's performance through the [Groundlight Dashboard](https://dashboard.groundlight.ai/).
Groundlight's human-in-the-loop technology intelligently monitors your image feed for anomalies and unexpected changes.
By reviewing and verifying results, you continuously improve the system's accuracy. Through the dashboard, you can also
configure text and email notifications to alert you when important events are detected in your video stream.

### Next Steps

Now that you've built your first application, learn how to write effective [queries](/docs/getting-started/writing-queries).
