# Groundlight Pi-Gen: Streamlining Raspberry Pi Setup for Computer Vision

Groundlight Pi-Gen simplifies the traditionally complex setup of computer vision applications on Raspberry Pi. By handling the complexities of AI and ensuring human oversight, Groundlight has already made strides in AI usability. This tool further eases the process, particularly for those utilizing Raspberry Pi in their setups.

## Why Groundlight Pi-Gen?
Setting up computer vision systems can be daunting. Groundlight Pi-Gen removes the hassle of configuring hardware and software by providing ready-to-use OS images, making the process straightforward and accessible.

## Raspberry Pi Imager: Your Gateway to Simplicity
The Raspberry Pi Imager offers a user-friendly way to burn these images onto an SD card. Before imaging, you can configure your Raspberry Pi's first-user login details, including username, password, SSH public key, and Wi-Fi settings, enabling a seamless headless setup.

### Obtaining and Using the Images
The customized `.img.xz` files are available as assets in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/groundlight/groundlight-pi-gen/releases). Download your chosen image and load it into the Raspberry Pi Imager. Remember to select "Use custom" under "Operating System" and proceed to choose your storage. Afterward, configure your device's credentials for an effortless setup.

## The Monitoring Notification Server (MNS): Effortless Deployment
Groundlight MNS is designed for ease of use. Once your Raspberry Pi boots up with the Groundlight OS, MNS becomes available on port 3000, usually within a few minutes. No coding or Docker knowledge is required; it's all set to work out of the box.
