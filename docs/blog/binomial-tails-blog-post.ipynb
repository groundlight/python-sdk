    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "At Groundlight, we put careful thought into measuring the correctness of our machine learning detectors. In the simplest case, this means measuring detector accuracy. But our customers have vastly different performance measurement needs since our platform allows one to train an ML model for virtually any Yes/No visual question-answering task. A single metric like accuracy is unlikely to provide adequate resolution for all such problems. Some customers might care more about false positive mistakes (precision) than false negative ones (recall), whereas others might care about false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide insight into detector performance for such varied use cases, yet still provide a single-number summary, Groundlight's **accuracy details** view displays a detector's [balanced accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#balanced-accuracy-score). Balanced accuracy is the average recall across all classes and is the prefered summary metric at Groundlight. For binary problems, this is just the mean of the accuracy on the YESs and the accuracy on the NOs. We like balanced accuracy because it is more intuitive and easier to understand than metrics like the F1 score or AUROC. And many commercially interesting problems are highly imbalanced - that is the answer is almost always NO, with very few YESs, or vice versa. For such problems, standard accuracy is not a good measure because always predicting the most common class will yield high accuracy, but will be useless in practice.\n",

    "    </figcaption>\n",
    "    </center>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, displaying the balanced accuracy alone is still not very informative as we do not always have an ample supply of **ground truth** labeled images to estimate it from. (Ground truth labels are answers to image queries that have been provided by customers or a knowledgeable customer representative, and are therefore guaranteed to be correct.) With only few ground truth labeled images, our estimate of a detector's balanced accuracy may be imprecise. As such, we've found it helpful to quantify and display just how accurate the detector's balanced accuracy estimate is by computing and displaying confidence intervals for the reported balanced accuracy. And this brings us to the subject of this blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Groundlight, we compute exact confidence intervals to upper and lower bound each detector's balanced accuracy. The detector's accuracy details view (figure 1 above) shows them as colored bars surrounding the reported accuracy number. This blog post describes how we compute these exact confidence intervals using the tails of the binomial distribution, and it also provides associated intuition along with the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the confidence intervals based on the Gaussian distribution which you may be familiar with, confidence intervals based on the binomial tails are exact and always valid, regardless of the number of ground truth labels available. Our exposition largely follows [Langford, 2005](https://jmlr.org/papers/v6/langford05a.html) and we use his \"program bound\" as a primitive to construct confidence intervals for the balanced accuracy metric."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate and construct confidence intervals for balanced accuracy, we first need to know how to construct confidence intervals for \"plain old\" standard accuracy. So we'll start here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that plain old accuracy is just the fraction of correct predictions that a classifier makes. To define this fraction rigorously, we make the assumption that there's a fixed distribution over the set of possible examples that our classifier might encounter. This distributional assumption helps us talk meaningfully about the classifier's \"true accuracy\". And to make it clear why it's needed, consider the case that our classifier performs well on daytime images but poorly on nighttime images. If the underlying distribution consists mainly of daytime images, then our classifier's accuracy will be high, but if it's mostly nighttime images, the accuracy will be low. Thus, the classifier's true accuracy is implicitly a function of the distribution of examples it's applied to. We almost never know what this distribution is (in fact, it's mainly a mathematical fiction, but a useful one). But for our classifier to possess something like a Platonic \"true accuracy\" that is immutable, we assume a distribution over examples that remains static and fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call this distribution over examples, $D$. Each example in $D$ consists of an image and an associated answer which is a binary label, either YES or NO. Let $\\mathcal{X}$ denote the set of all possible images; $\\mathcal{Y}$ = { YES, NO } denote the set of possible labels for those images; and let $(x,y) \\sim D$ denote the action of sampling an example from $D$. We conceptualize our machine learning classifier as a function, $h$, that maps from the set of images, $\\mathcal{X}$ to the set of labels, $\\mathcal{Y}$. And we say that $h$ correctly classifies an example $(x,y)$ if $h(x) = y$ and that $h$ misclassifies it otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to construct a confidence inverval for the true but unknown accuracy of $h$, which we define as the probability that $h$ correctly classifies an example drawn from $D$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\text{acc}_{D}(h) = \\Pr_{(x,y) \\sim D}[ \\,h(x) = y\\, ].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The true accuracy is impossible to compute exactly because $D$ is unknown and the universe of possible images is impossibly large. However, we can estimate it by evaluating $h$ on a finite test set of examples, $S$, which have been [drawn i.i.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables) from $D$. That is,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\{ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_{n}, y_{n}) \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $(x_i, y_i) \\sim D$ for $i=1,\\ldots,n$. The fraction of $S$ that $h$ correctly classifies is called the classifier's empirical accuracy on $S$,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\widehat{\\text{acc}}_{S}(h) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{1}[\\, h(x_i) = y_i \\,].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The notation, $\\mathbf{1}[\\, \\texttt{condition} \\,]$, denotes the indicator function which equals 1 when $\\texttt{condition}$ is true and 0 otherwise. So the formula above is just a way of counting the number of examples from $S$ that are correctly classified and dividing by n."

    "## Upper Bounding the True Accuracy from Test Set Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an understanding of the number of tosses that land heads given a possibly unfair coin and how it mirrors the number of correctly classified examples on a sampled test set, let's consider the problem of determining an upper bound for the true accuracy of a classifier given its performance on a randomly sampled test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we sample a test set, $S$, of 100 examples from $D$ and that our classifier, $h$, correctly classifies 80 of these 100 examples. Our goal is to upper bound the true accuracy, $\\text{acc}_D(h)$, based on the fact that the empirical accuracy, $\\widehat{\\text{acc}}_S(h)$, is observed to be 80/100 = 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by considering what would be the case if we used our observed / empirical accuracy of 80% as the upper bound. In the cell below, we plot the PMF of the binomial distribution with parameters N=100 and p=0.80. Here, N is the test set size and p corresponds to the true (but unknown) classifier accuracy. The plot shows that if the true accuracy was in fact 80%, there would be a very good chance of observing an even lower empirical accuracy than what we observed, which was the empirical accuracy of 80%. This fact is represented by the substantial probability mass to the left of the purple vertical line placed at the empirical accuracy point of 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the CDF of the binomial tells us that there is a 54% chance of seeing an empirical accuracy of 80% **or less** when N=100 and the true accuracy is 80%. And since 54% is quite high, the choice of 80% as an upper bound doesn't appear to very conservative. It would therefore be wise to increase our upper bound if we want it to be an upper bound!"

    "In contrast, the plot below shows that if the true accuracy were a bit higher, at 83%, we would observe an empirical accuracy of 80% or less on roughy one quarter of test sets sampled. This is shown by the 24.8% probability mass located to the left of the purple line at the 80% empirical accuracy point. The red line is positioned at the hypothesized true accuracy of 83%. Since the chance of observing an empirical accuracy of 80% (or less) when the true accuracy is 83% is roughly one in four, 83% seems like a more conservative upper bound than our initially proposed upper bound of 80%. But still, events with one in four odds are quite likely to be observed, so choosing an even larger upper bound would be wise."

    "### Constructing a 95% Upper Confidence Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure we outlined above, of increasing the hypothesized true accuracy starting from the observed empirical accuracy until exactly 5% of the binomial's probability mass lies to the left of the empirical accuracy, is how we construct an **exact** 95% upper confidence bound on the true accuracy. Remarkably, if we apply this procedure many times to find the 95% accuracy upper confidence bounds for different Groundlight ML models, the obtained upper bounds will in fact be larger than the true accuracies 95% of the time. This last statement is a little subtle and is worth pondering because it is exactly the right way to think about the guarantee provided by a 95% upper confidence bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, a procedure that produces a 95% upper confidence bound for the true accuracy will output a quantity that is greater than the classifier's true accuracy on 95% of test sets sampled (assuming that test sets are sampled i.i.d. from a fixed distribution and the classifier is not being retrained or otherwise modified).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exact Upper Confidence Bounds based on the Binomial CDF\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we've gained intuition by running through the procedure used to construct accuracy upper confidence bounds at Groundlight, we are ready for to give the more general and formal treatment which will be helpful when we discuss confidence intervals for balanced accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, recall that we defined the binomial cumulative density function (CDF), $F_{N,p}(k)$, which gives the probability of observing $k$ or fewer heads when $N$ tosses have been made and the coin's true bias is $p$. If we let $N$ be the number of test set examples and $k$ be the number of correctly classified test cases, then $k/N$ is our empirical accuracy. The true accuracy $p$ is is of course unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, recall that we decided to put exactly 5% of the probability mass to left of the empirical accuracy, and doing so gave us a 95% upper confidence bound. But we needn't have picked 5%. We could have instead put 1% of the lower tail mass to the left of the empirical accuracy, and in doing so we would have obtained a 99% upper confidence bound. The 99% upper bound would be looser than the 95% upper bound, but it would hold on 99% of test sets sampled as opposed to just 95%. The amount of coverage versus tightness of the bound is a trade off that we get to make based on our preferences. We therefore treat it as a parameter that we can set called $\\delta$. Above we let $\\delta$ be 5% but we could have picked some other number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to formally define exact the upper confidence bound based on the binomial CDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** a 100(1 - $\\delta$)% binomial upper confidence bound, $\\bar{p}$, for an observed proportion, $k/N$, is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{p}(N, k, \\delta) = \\max \\{ \\, p \\,:\\, F_{N,p}(k) \\ge \\delta \\,\\, \\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy upper bound, $\\bar{p}$, is the maximum accuracy for which there exists at least $\\delta$ probability mass in the lower tail. And this definition exactly mirrors the procedure we used above to find a 95% upper confidence bound on the true accuracy. We had picked $\\bar{p}$ to be the max $p$ such that the CDF $F_{N=100,p}(k=80)$ was equal to $\\delta$ of 5%. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily implement the above definition in code. To find the 100(1 - $\\delta$)% upper confidence bound when our classifier misclassifies $k$ out of $N$ examples, we use the binomial's CDF to find the largest value of $p$ for which $F_{N,p}(k) \\ge \\delta$. The binomial CDF function is available in python through the `scipy.stats` module as `binom.cdf`. \n",
    "However the binomial CDF isn't directly invertible, so we can't just plug in $\\delta$ and get $\\bar{p}$ out. Instead we need to search over possible values of $p$ until we find the largest one that satisfies the inequality.  We can do this efficiently using the interval bisection method. The code below implements this.\n",

    "## Lower Confidence Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to our discussion of coin flips makes it immediately clear how to construct a lower bound on the true accuracy of our classifier. We had likened a correct classification as coin flip that landed heads. But we just as easily could have likened them to a coin flip landing tails. In this case, an upper bound on the probability of tails would correspond to an upper bound on the classifier's error rate, i.e., the true fraction of misclassifiactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since the error rate is just one minus the accuracy, we can immediately obtain a lower bound on the accuracy by upper bounding the error rate and subtracting it from one.\n",

    "The main benefit of using bounds derived from the binomial CDF is that they are exact and contain the true accuracy exactly the desired fraction of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare this with the more commonly used bounds based on approximating the binomial with a normal distribution. The motivation for the normal approximation comes from the central limit theorem, and states that for a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $p$, the distribution of the empirical estimate, $\\hat{p} = k/N$, converges to a normal distribution as the sample size, $N$, goes to infinity,\n",

    "\n",
    "But this interval poorly approximates the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ when $p$ is close to zero or one. For instance, if we observe zero errors on the test set, then $\\hat{p}$ will equal one (100% empirical accuracy). The estimated standard deviation, $\\hat{\\sigma}$, will be zero, and therefore the estimated lower bound will equal the empirical accuracy of 100%, which is clearly not believable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since we want classifiers that have close to 100% accuracy, the regime in which $p$ is close to one is exactly the regime that our customers care about. Thus, the exact confidence intervals based on the binomial CDF are far more accurate in practice than those based on the normal approximation."

    "The semantics around frequentist confidence intervals is subtle and confusing. The construction of a 95% upper confidence bound does **NOT** imply there is a 95% probability that the true accuracy is less than the bound. It only guarantees that the true accuracy is less than the upper bound in about 95% of the cases that we run the the upper confidence bound procedure (assuming we run the procedure many many times). For each individual case, the true accuracy is either greater than or less than the bound, and thus is less than the bound with probability one or zero (we just don't know which).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you instead want these conditional semantics, you need to use Bayesian credible intervals. See [Brodersen et al., 2010](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5597285) for a nice derivation."
